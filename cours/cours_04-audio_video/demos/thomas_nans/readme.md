**VIDEO PLAYER WITH UI BACKGROUND**

I wanted to create a very simple video player with a nice user interface. This is a school project.

# To launch the player

Just unzip the file, open the index.html and enjoy the Drake Music.

# To Change the video

If you want to change the video source, just change the two <video> src and don’t forget to add 2 sources in the src/video folder (one on SD et one on HD)

# Features
	# Seek-bar with gradient
	# Current Time & Total Time
	# Sound level and Mute
	# Play, Pause, Forward & Rearward
	# Replay the video
	# FullScreen with the custom control
	# HD on/off
	# Background Light Video

# Bug
	# Opacity on the seek-bar
	# Opacity on the Volume Bar
	# Hide the control on FullScreen Mode
	# Sometimes the video BG is not on the same time
	# Hight Latency when we launch the index.html

# Future Features
	# A really pick color for the BG, because in my currently version is not very clean and it’s very heavy for the WebBrowser
  # The possibility to had other video and to select them
  # Thumbnails on the seek-bar hover (Like Youtube preview)

Thank you for this project, it allowed me to grow in Javascript!
